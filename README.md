## DevilBotRustExt
***
An alternate instance of DevilBot
designed to speed up bot execution
in the superior Rust.

As of right now, the bot runs on
a seperate instance, with a seperate
prefix to be used for rust-only commands
in order to create seamlessness between
the ['old'](https://github.com/DevilJamJar/DevilBot) bot and what will become the
new one. Eventually the bot will become
entirely written in Rust.
